# Python Recreational Mathematics
Implementations of interesting mathematical concepts that I've researched!

## Primality
- Miller-Rabins Test (O(k * logn))
    
### Sieves
- Eratosthenes (O(n log log n))

- Sundaram (O(n log n))

- Atkin (O(n / log log n))

## Cryptography
- Substitution Cypher (O(m * k), where m is the number of lines and k is the mean number of characters per line)

## Number Series
- Harshad (in bases 2-36)

- Figurates
