# Python Recreational Mathematics
Implementations of interesting mathematical concepts that I've researched!

These include:

Primality!

- Sieves (utlising nump arrays)

  - Eratosthenes ('O(n log log n)')

  - Sundaram ('O(n log n)')

  - Atkin ('O(n / log log n)')

- Miller-Rabins Test ('O(k * logn)')

Cryptography!

- Substitution Cypher (w/ time complexity 'O(m * k)', where 'm' is the number of lines and 'k' is the mean number of characters per line)

Number Series!

- Harshad (generated in bases 2-36 w/ time complexity 'O(limit * log(num))', where 'num' is the maximum number from 1 to 'limit')

- Figurates ('O(n)')
