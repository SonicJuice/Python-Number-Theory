# Python Recreational Mathematics
Implementations of interesting mathematical concepts that I've researched!

These include:

Primality!

- Sieves

  - Eratosthenes ('O(n log log n)')

  - Sundaram ('O(n log n)')

  - Atkin ('O(n / log log n)')

- Miller-Rabins Test ('O(k * logn)')

Cryptography!

- Substitution Cypher ('O(m * k)', where 'm' is the number of lines and 'k' is the mean number of characters per line)

Number Series!

- Harshad (in bases 2-36)

- Figurates
