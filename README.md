# Python Number Theory
Implementations of interesting number theory concepts that I've researched!

These include:

Prime-Based Algorithms!

- Sieves!

  - Eratosthenes (utilising numpy arrays and w/ time complexity 'O(n log log n)')

  - Atkin ('O(n / log log n)')

  - Sundaram ('O(n log n)')

- Miller-Rabins Primality Test

Cryptographic Algorithms!

- Substitution Cypher ('O(m * k)', where 'm' is the number of lines and 'k' is the average number of characters per line)

Number Series!

- Harshad Series (generated in bases 2-36 w/ time complexity 'O(limit * log(num))', where num is the maximum number from 1 to limit inclusive)

- Harmonic Series
