# Python Number Theory Research
Implementations of number theory-based algorithms that I've researched!

These include:

Prime-Based Algorithms!

- Sieve of Eratosthenes (utilising numpy arrays and having a time complexity of 'O(n log log n)')

- Sieve of Atkin ('O(n / log log n)')

- Sieve of Sundaram ('O(n log n)')

- Primality Checker ('O(sqrt(n))')

Cryptographic Algorithms!

- Substitution Cypher ('O(m * k)', where 'm' is the number of lines, and 'k' is the average number of characters per line)

Number Series!

- Harshad Numbers

- Harmonic Series
